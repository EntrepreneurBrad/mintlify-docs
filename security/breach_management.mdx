We take security seriously. Our systems are designed to prevent breaches — but if one occurs, we act fast to contain and resolve it while keeping you informed.

## Incident Response Plan

- **Prepared Protocols** – A documented response plan outlines how we detect, contain, and resolve security incidents.
- **Compliance-Driven** – We follow the Notifiable Data Breach scheme and relevant privacy laws.

## Breach Notification

- **Timely Updates** – If your data is affected, we notify you without delay.
- **Clear Communication** – Notifications explain what happened, what data was involved, and what’s being done.

## Penetration Testing

- **Annual Assessments** – Independent security experts run penetration tests to uncover vulnerabilities.
- **Risk-Based Resolution** – Any issues are fixed quickly, prioritised by severity.
