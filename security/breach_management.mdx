We take security seriously. Our systems are designed to prevent breaches — but if one occurs, we act fast to contain and resolve it while keeping you informed.

---

## Incident Response Plan

- **Prepared Protocols** – A documented response plan outlines how we detect, contain, and resolve security incidents.
- **Compliance-Driven** – We follow the Notifiable Data Breach scheme and relevant privacy laws.

---

## Breach Notification

- **Timely Updates** – If your data is affected, we notify you without delay.
- **Clear Communication** – Notifications explain what happened, what data was involved, and what’s being done.

---

## Penetration Testing

- **Internal Assessments** – Our technical team conducts regular penetration tests against our platform, including web applications, APIs, and infrastructure components, using industry-standard tools and methodologies.
- **OWASP-Based Methodology** – Testing is guided by the OWASP Top 10 and includes checks for authentication flaws, injection vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, access control issues, and more.
- **Risk-Based Remediation** – Any identified issues are triaged by severity and resolved promptly. We maintain internal records of findings and remediation actions.
- **Part of Ongoing Security Posture** – Penetration testing is integrated into our broader security process alongside code reviews, automated vulnerability scans, and patch management.
