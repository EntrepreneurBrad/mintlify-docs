Your information is securely stored on servers located in Australia and protected using industry-standard security practices. We are committed to safeguarding your data through the following measures:

- **Encrypted Storage** – All data is encrypted in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorised access.
- **Regular Backups** – Frequent backups are performed to minimise the risk of data loss due to system failures or unforeseen issues.
- **Access Controls** – Access to personal data is strictly limited to authorised personnel and monitored for security and compliance.

We do not retain unnecessary personal information beyond the period required for the intended educational purposes.

## Student Data Retention & Deletion

In line with our data retention policy and privacy obligations, we periodically review and manage stored data. At the end of each academic year, we automatically delete the accounts and associated data of Year 12 students who have graduated. This helps ensure that we only retain data for active users and reduces the risk of holding data longer than necessary.

We comply with applicable privacy laws and are committed to transparent, responsible data management. If you have any questions or would like to request data deletion, you can contact us at any time at [data-protection@exam-insights.com](mailto:data-protection@exam-insights.com).

## **TLS Enforcement**

We ensure that all communications with our systems are encrypted using industry-standard protocols.

- **Mandatory Encryption in Transit** – All web traffic is secured using TLS 1.2 or higher, safeguarding data against interception and tampering.
- **End-to-End Protection** – Secure transport protocols are enforced across all endpoints and integrations.

---

## **Data Encryption at Rest**

We implement robust encryption controls to protect data stored within our systems.

- **Comprehensive Data Protection** – All confidential and sensitive data is encrypted at rest using industry-accepted algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- **Controlled Environments** – Data is stored in secure infrastructure with monitored access controls and encryption key management.

---

## **Encrypted Backups**

Our backup systems are secured to prevent unauthorised access and ensure data integrity.

- **Encryption Standards** – Backup data is encrypted during transfer and while at rest, following best practices for cryptographic protection.
- **Access Restriction** – Access to backup systems is limited to authorised personnel and governed by strict role-based access controls.

---

## **Immutable Backup Storage**

We implement protections to ensure that backup data remains unaltered and recoverable.

- **Tamper-Proof Storage** – Backups are stored in immutable formats that prevent unauthorised changes.
- **Data Integrity Assurance** – These safeguards ensure the availability and accuracy of backups in the event of a system failure or attack.

## **Data Deletion Upon Termination**

We provide mechanisms to ensure complete and irreversible deletion of customer data upon service termination.

- **Timely Erasure** – Upon written request, all customer data is permanently deleted within 30 calendar days of account termination.
- **Secure Disposal** – Data is purged in accordance with secure deletion standards, including those outlined in ISO/IEC 27040 and NIST SP 800-88.
