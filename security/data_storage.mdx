## Student Data Retention & Deletion

In line with our data retention policy and privacy obligations, we periodically review and manage stored data. At the end of each academic year, we automatically delete the accounts and associated data of Year 12 students who have graduated. This helps ensure that we only retain data for active users and reduces the risk of holding data longer than necessary.

We comply with applicable privacy laws and are committed to transparent, responsible data management. If you have any questions or would like to request data deletion, you can contact us at any time at [support@exam-insights.com](mailto:support@exam-insights.com).
