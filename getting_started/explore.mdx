At a glance, the Overview gives you insights into your progress:

* **Attempted vs. Unattempted Learning Objectives** – A graph showing how many learning objectives you've attempted versus those you haven't engaged with yet.

**Insights**

Insights use data from past QCAA exam papers to highlight exam trends related to the chosen syllabus point. This can include how often a concept has appeared in past exams, common question formats, and key themes to focus on. By reviewing these insights, you can get a better idea of what to expect and how to prepare for future assessments.
