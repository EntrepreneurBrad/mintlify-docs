## Feature Overview

### Syllabus

Syllabus is your interactive roadmap to mastering a subject, giving you full access to the official QCAA syllabus in a structured and intuitive way. It goes beyond a simple outline, providing dedicated pages for every unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective.

With everything connected, you can focus on what matters most—finding the right questions ([Questions](/getting_started/questions)), tracking your progress ([Performance](/getting_started/performance)), and gaining deeper insights ([Insights](/getting_started/insights))—all in a single, streamlined hub built for effective learning.

### Questions

Questions is at the heart of Exam Insights, offering a flexible playground for exploring past QCAA external exam questions. It’s more than just a question bank—you have full control over what you see by combining powerful filters to narrow down exactly what you need.

Filter by unit, topic, sub-topic, difficulty, cognitive verbs, and more to pinpoint the most relevant questions for your study or teaching focus. Whether you’re searching for a specific type of question or a broader range, everything you need is in one place—including the formula book, marking scheme, and any relevant stimulus.

### Insights

Insights provides a data-driven playground for analysing past QCAA external exams, helping both students and educators identify trends and focus effectively.

Here, you can explore all available data and apply filters to see exactly what matters to you—whether it’s question frequency, mark distribution, or cognitive verb trends. Every data point is interactive, allowing you to drill down into specific topics, question formats, and difficulty levels, eliminating guesswork so students can study smarter and educators can guide learning more strategically.

### Performance

Performance is where you can see all your progress in one place. It takes the reflections you’ve given after answering questions and turns them into clear, visual insights.

With interactive graphs and insights, you can monitor trends in your performance over time, identify which topics need more focus, and refine your study strategies accordingly. Whether you’re aiming to reinforce your understanding or challenge yourself with tougher questions, Performance equips you with the data you need to study smarter.
