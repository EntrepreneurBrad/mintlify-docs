## Using Performance

### How Your Data is Collected

<Tip>
  Performance relies on our **Question Reflection** feature. To learn more, visit our guide [here](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).  
</Tip>

After answering a question, you‚Äôll rate your confidence in solving it again using a 5-point scale.

üíö 5 - Confident ‚Äì I understand this completely and can explain it to someone else.
üíô 4 - Mostly confident ‚Äì I get it, but I might need a quick refresher.
üíõ 3 - Somewhat confident ‚Äì I understand parts of it but need more practice.
üß° 2 - Unsure ‚Äì I struggled and need to review this concept.
‚ù§Ô∏è 1 - Not confident ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt understand this at all and need to study it further.

Your rating automatically saves in the background, contributing to your Performance History and filtering options‚Äîso over time, you‚Äôll build a clear picture of your strong and weak areas.


### What Your Data Tells You

With Performance you can:

* Identify weak areas and direct your study efforts where they‚Äôre needed most.
* Monitor progress over time to see how your understanding evolves. EVEN DOWN TO QUESTION REFLECTION HISTORY - VIEW [HERE](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).
* Filter questions based on past performance to revisit challenging topics. VIEW [HERE](/getting_started/questions#filtering-questions).
* Use data-driven insights to refine your exam preparation strategy. 



The Performance page provides detailed insights into how well you‚Äôre doing across different study areas. It tracks your progress using two key data points:

* **Average Rating** ‚Äì Measures the quality of your answers based on how you‚Äôve rated yourself.

* **Questions Breakdown** ‚Äì Tracks the number of questions answered, categorised by rating.

Both of these metrics are broken down across multiple study dimensions, allowing you to see trends in different areas, including:

* **Unit, Topic, Subtopic, Learning Objective**¬†‚Äì See how your performance varies across the syllabus.

* **Format** ‚Äì Tracks your ratings in Multiple Choice, Short Response, and other question types.

* **Year** ‚Äì Track performance on questions from specific past exams.

* **Difficulty** ‚Äì Monitor performance across easy, medium, and hard questions.

* **Cognitive Verbs** ‚Äì Tracks questions including Explain, Justify, Evaluate, etc.

By tracking these metrics, Performance helps you make data-driven study decisions to improve your exam preparation.

### How to Use Effectively

**Average Rating**

Your Average Rating is calculated based on how you‚Äôve rated your answers across different metrics. This gives you a clear picture of where you‚Äôre performing well and where extra practice might be needed.

For example, if your average rating is higher in multiple-choice questions but lower in short response questions, this may indicate you need more practice with written explanations.

**Questions Breakdown**

The Questions graph helps you visualise the number of questions you‚Äôve answered in each category and how you‚Äôve rated them.

Each bar in the graph is color-coded based on your rating:

* **Dark Green** ‚Äì 5-Star (Strong performance)

* **Light Green** ‚Äì 4-Star

* **Yellow** ‚Äì 3-Star

* **Orange** ‚Äì 2-Star

* **Red** ‚Äì 1-Star (Needs improvement)

* **Gray** ‚Äì Unrated (Questions you haven‚Äôt rated)

**How to Use It**

* **Identify areas needing improvement** ‚Äì If a bar has a lot of red and orange, that‚Äôs a sign to focus more on those questions.

* **Spot gaps in your study plan** ‚Äì Unrated questions may indicate areas you haven‚Äôt covered yet.
