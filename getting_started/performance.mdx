The Performance Page is your personal progress tracker, helping you understand how well you’re doing across different areas of study. By collecting data from the rating system in the Questions Feature, it generates personalised insights that show your strengths and areas for improvement.

## What Does the Performance Page Track?

### Average Rating

As the name suggests, average rating tracks the average rating you’ve given to questions across different metrics, giving you a clear picture of where you’re performing well and where you might need extra practice.

### Questions Breakdown

This section tracks the number of questions you’ve answered in each metric. The graph is also color-coded to reflect how you rated those questions:

**Color-Coded Ratings**

Each bar in the graph is divided into segments based on your question ratings:

* **Gray** – Unrated

* **Red** – 1-Star

* **Orange** – 2-Star

* **Yellow** – 3-Star

* **Light Green** – 4-Star

* **Dark Green** – 5-Star

  To remove a segment from the bar, simply click on it in the legend, and it will be hidden from the graph.
