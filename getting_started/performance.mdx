Performance is where you can see all your progress in one place. It takes the reflections you’ve given after answering questions and turns them into clear, visual insights. 

With interactive graphs and insights, you can monitor trends in your performance over time, identify which topics need more focus, and refine your study strategies accordingly. Whether you’re aiming to reinforce your understanding or challenge yourself with tougher questions, Performance equips you with the data you need to study smarter.

## Using Performance

### How Your Data is Collected

<Tip>
Performance is powered by **Question Reflection**, which occurs when you're **attempting questions**. To learn more, visit our guide [here](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).  
</Tip>

Performance helps you track your understanding and confidence while working through questions. Each time you attempt a question, you’ll use a simple 5-scale reflection system to rate how well you understood the question and how confident you are in solving it again.

* **5** - Confident – I understand this completely and can explain it to someone else.
* **4** - Mostly confident – I get it, but I might need a quick refresher.
* **3** - Somewhat confident – I understand parts of it but need more practice.
* **2** - Unsure – I struggled and need to review this concept.
* **1** - Not confident – I didn’t understand this at all and need to study it further.


Your ratings automatically save in the background and help you:
* Filter questions based on past ratings, so you can revisit tricky topics.
* Monitor your progress over time in the Performance page to spot strengths and learning gaps.

With minimal effort, you’ll build a clear picture of where to focus, making your exam preparation more targeted and effective.

### What Your Data Tells You

With Performance you can:

* Identify weak areas and direct your study efforts where they’re needed most.
* Monitor progress over time to see how your understanding evolves. EVEN DOWN TO QUESTION REFLECTION HISTORY - VIEW [HERE](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).
* Filter questions based on past performance to revisit challenging topics. VIEW [HERE](/getting_started/questions#filtering-questions).
* Use data-driven insights to refine your exam preparation strategy. 

The Performance page provides detailed insights into how well you’re doing across different study areas. It tracks your progress using two key data points:

* **Average Rating** – Measures the quality of your answers based on how you’ve rated yourself.

* **Questions Breakdown** – Tracks the number of questions answered, categorised by rating.

Both of these metrics are broken down across multiple study dimensions, allowing you to see trends in different areas, including:

* **Unit, Topic, Subtopic, Learning Objective** – See how your performance varies across the syllabus.

* **Format** – Tracks your ratings in Multiple Choice, Short Response, and other question types.

* **Year** – Track performance on questions from specific past exams.

* **Difficulty** – Monitor performance across easy, medium, and hard questions.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Tracks questions including Explain, Justify, Evaluate, etc.

By tracking these metrics, Performance helps you make data-driven study decisions to improve your exam preparation.

### How to Use Effectively

**How to Use It**

* **Identify areas needing improvement** – If a bar has a lot of red and orange, that’s a sign to focus more on those questions.

* **Monitor question volume** – Check if you’ve answered enough questions in a given category.

* **Spot gaps in your study plan** – Unrated questions may indicate areas you haven’t covered yet.

***

**Average Rating**

Your Average Rating is calculated based on how you’ve rated your answers across different metrics. This gives you a clear picture of where you’re performing well and where extra practice might be needed.

For example, if your average rating is higher in multiple-choice questions but lower in short response questions, this may indicate you need more practice with written explanations.

**How to Use It**

• Identify **strong areas** where you consistently rate yourself highly.

• Spot **weaker areas** that need more focus.

• Track **changes over time** to see improvement in specific topics or question types.

***

**Questions Breakdown**

The Questions graph helps you visualise the number of questions you’ve answered in each category and how you’ve rated them.

Each bar in the graph is color-coded based on your rating:

* **Dark Green** – 5-Star (Strong performance)

* **Light Green** – 4-Star

* **Yellow** – 3-Star

* **Orange** – 2-Star

* **Red** – 1-Star (Needs improvement)

* **Gray** – Unrated (Questions you haven’t rated)

<Tip>
  To remove a segment from the bar, simply click on it in the legend, and it will be hidden from the graph.
