Performance is where you can see all your progress in one place. It takes the reflections you’ve given after answering questions and turns them into clear, visual data. 

With interactive graphs and breakdowns, you can monitor trends in your performance over time, identify which topics need more focus, and refine your study strategies accordingly. Whether you’re aiming to reinforce your understanding or challenge yourself with tougher questions, Performance equips you with the data you need to study smarter.

<Note>
  This feature is **free**, but requires a **free account**, offering a breakdown of **Units & Topics**. Upgrade to **Pro** for full access to all performance metrics.

## Using Performance

### How Data is Collected

<Tip>
Performance is powered by **Question Reflection**, which occurs when you're **attempting questions**. To learn more, visit our guide [here](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).  
</Tip>

Each time you attempt a question, you’ll use a simple 5-scale reflection system to rate how well you understood the question and how confident you are in solving it again.

These reflections are automatically saved in the background, allowing you to track your progress over time without any extra effort.

The scale is as follows:
* **5 (Confident)** – I understand this completely and can explain it to someone else.
* **4 (Mostly Confident)** – I get it, but I might need a quick refresher.
* **3 (Somewhat Confident)** – I understand parts of it but need more practice.
* **2 (Unsure)** – I struggled and need to review this concept.
* **1 (Not Confident)** – I didn’t understand this at all and need to study it further.

### Understanding Key Metrics

Performance summarises your reflections using two key metrics:
* **Reflection Average** – The average of your reflections, allowing you to compare your confidence across different categories, such as topics, question formats, difficulty levels, or cognitive verbs.
* **Reflection Breakdown** – A breakdown of how many questions fall into each confidence level, helping you track areas of strength, improvement, and unanswered questions across different categories.

Beyond these core metrics, your reflections also help you:
* Filter questions based on your most recent reflections - learn more [here](/getting_started/questions#filtering-questions).
* Monitor progress over time to see how your understanding evolves for each individual question - learn more [here](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).

<Frame caption="Caption">

</Frame>

These are broken down into different categories to help you identify trends:
* **Subject Matter** – Track your performance across units, topics, subtopics, and learning objectives.
* **Question Format** – Compare your performance across Multiple Choice, Short Response, and other question types.
* **Paper / Technology** – Track how you perform on questions that require a calculator or specific tools.
* **Year** – Track how you perform on past exam questions from different years.
* **Difficulty Level** – Monitor your confidence across easy, medium, and hard questions.
* **Cognitive Verbs** – Identify patterns in questions that require specific skills like Explain, Justify, or Evaluate.

By analysing these categories, Performance helps you make informed study decisions and focus on the areas that will have the greatest impact on your results.

### Understanding Your Average Rating

Your Average Rating is calculated based on how you’ve rated your answers across different metrics. This gives you a clear picture of where you’re performing well and where extra practice might be needed.

For example, if your average rating is higher in multiple-choice questions but lower in short response questions, this may indicate you need more practice with written explanations.

**How to Use It**

• Identify **strong areas** where you consistently rate yourself highly.

• Spot **weaker areas** that need more focus.

• Track **changes over time** to see improvement in specific topics or question types.

### Understanding Your Questions Breakdown

**Questions Breakdown**

The Questions graph helps you visualise the number of questions you’ve answered in each category and how you’ve rated them.

Each bar in the graph is color-coded based on your rating:

* **Dark Green** – 5-Star (Strong performance)

* **Light Green** – 4-Star

* **Yellow** – 3-Star

* **Orange** – 2-Star

* **Red** – 1-Star (Needs improvement)

* **Gray** – Unrated (Questions you haven’t rated)

<Tip>
  To remove a segment from the bar, simply click on it in the legend, and it will be hidden from the graph.
