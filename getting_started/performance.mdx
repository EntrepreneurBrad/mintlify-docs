## How to Use Performance

### Average Rating

As the name suggests, average rating tracks the average rating you’ve given to questions across different metrics, giving you a clear picture of where you’re performing well and where you might need extra practice.

### Questions Breakdown

This section tracks the number of questions you’ve answered in each metric. The graph is also color-coded to reflect how you rated those questions:

**Color-Coded Ratings**

Each bar in the graph is divided into segments based on your question ratings:

* **Gray** – Unrated

* **Red** – 1-Star

* **Orange** – 2-Star

* **Yellow** – 3-Star

* **Light Green** – 4-Star

* **Dark Green** – 5-Star

<Tip>
  To remove a segment from the bar, simply click on it in the legend, and it will be hidden from the graph.
