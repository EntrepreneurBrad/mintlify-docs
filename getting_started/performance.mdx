Performance is where you can see all your progress in one place. It takes the reflections you’ve given after answering questions and turns them into clear, visual data.

With interactive graphs and breakdowns, you can monitor trends in your performance over time, identify which topics need more focus, and refine your study strategies accordingly. Whether you’re aiming to reinforce your understanding or challenge yourself with tougher questions, Performance equips you with the data you need to study smarter.

<Note>
  This feature is **free**, but requires a **free account**, offering a breakdown of **Units & Topics**. Upgrade to **Pro** for full access to all performance metrics.

## Where to Find Performance

Finding the Performance page is simple, with two easy ways.

<Tip>
  Want a better understanding of how Exam Insights is structured? Check out our [Quick Start Guide](/getting_started/quick_start_guide) to see how our pages are organised and where to find key features.
</Tip>

### Option 1: From the Homepage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your My Subjects (Home)">
    This is where all of your enrolled subjects are listed.

    <Frame caption="The My Subjects (Home) Page">
      ![](/images/Untitleddesign.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Subject">
    Click on the subject you want to view Performance for.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Performance">
    Once inside the subject, you’ll see the Performance option.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Using the Sidebar

- When you’re inside a subject, the Performance tab is always available in the left sidebar for quick access, or by clicking the menu button on the top right of the screen for smaller devices.
- Simply click on _Performance_.

## Using Performance

### How Data is Collected

<Tip>
  Performance is powered by **Question Reflection**, which occurs when you're **attempting questions**. To learn more, visit our guide [here](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).
</Tip>

Each time you attempt a question, you’ll use a simple 5-scale reflection system to rate how well you understood the question and how confident you are in solving it again.

These reflections are automatically saved in the background, allowing you to track your progress over time without any extra effort.

The scale is as follows:

- **5 (Confident)** – I understand this completely and can explain it to someone else.
- **4 (Mostly Confident)** – I get it, but I might need a quick refresher.
- **3 (Somewhat Confident)** – I understand parts of it but need more practice.
- **2 (Unsure)** – I struggled and need to review this concept.
- **1 (Not Confident)** – I didn’t understand this at all and need to study it further.

### Understanding Key Metrics

Performance summarises your reflections using two key metrics:

- **Reflection Average** – The average of your most recent reflections for each question within a specific category (e.g., topic, question format, or cognitive verb), displayed as a bar chart to help you compare your confidence levels across different areas.
- **Reflection Distribution** – A breakdown of how many questions fall into each confidence level, helping you track areas of strength, improvement, and unanswered questions across different categories.

---

These are broken down into different categories to help you identify trends:

- **Subject Matter** – Track your performance across units, topics, sub-topics, and learning objectives.
- **Question Format** – Compare your performance across Multiple Choice, Short Response, and other question types.
- **Paper / Technology** – Track how you perform on questions that require a calculator or specific tools.
- **Year** – Track how you perform on past exam questions from different years.
- **Difficulty Level** – Monitor your confidence across easy, medium, and hard questions.
- **Cognitive Verbs** – Identify patterns in questions that require specific skills like Explain, Justify, or Evaluate.

By analysing these categories, Performance helps you make informed study decisions and focus on the areas that will have the greatest impact on your results.

---

Beyond these core metrics, your reflections also help you:

- Filter questions based on your most recent reflections - learn more [here](/getting_started/questions#filtering-questions).
- Monitor progress over time to see how your understanding evolves for each individual question - learn more [here](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).

### Understanding Average Reflection

<Frame caption="Average Reflection on the QCAA Physics Performance Page">
  ![6 Performance Overview Jpe](/images/6-PerformanceOverview.jpeg)
</Frame>

Your Reflection Average is based on your most recent reflection for each question within a specific category (e.g., topic, question format, or cognitive verb). It constantly updates as you reflect on more questions, ensuring an accurate snapshot of your current confidence.

This bar chart helps you compare different areas at a glance, highlighting where you feel most confident and where you might need more practice.

<Note>
  **For example:** If your Reflection Average is higher in multiple-choice but lower in short response, you may need to practice written explanations more.
</Note>

Use Average Reflection to:

- **Identify strong areas** – Categories with higher averages indicate where you’re performing well.
- **Spot weaker areas** – Lower averages highlight where more focus is needed.
- **Track progress over time** – If an area isn’t improving, it may require a different study approach.

### Understanding Reflection Distributions

<Frame caption="Reflection Distributions on the QCAA Physics Performance Page">
  ![33 Reflection Distribution Overview Jpe](/images/33-ReflectionDistributionOverview.jpeg)
</Frame>

Your Reflection Distribution tracks how many questions you’ve most recently reflected on at each confidence level within a specific category (e.g., topic, question format, or cognitive verb). It constantly updates as you reflect on more questions, ensuring an accurate picture of your strengths, areas for improvement, and unanswered questions.

This graph helps you see patterns in your reflections at a glance, highlighting which areas have strong confidence and where more practice may be needed.

<Note>
  **For example:** If a category has a high number of 1s and 2s (lower confidence ratings), it may need more focused study, whereas a category with mostly 4s and 5s indicates stronger understanding.
</Note>

Use Reflection Distributions to:

- **Spot patterns in your learning** – A high number of low-confidence reflections signals areas that need reinforcement.
- **Ensure balanced study** – If some categories have very few reflections, you may need to practice more in those areas.
- **Track unanswered questions** – Gray bars indicate questions that haven’t been reflected on yet.

<Tip>
  To remove a segment from the bar, simply click on it in the legend, and it will be hidden from the graph.
