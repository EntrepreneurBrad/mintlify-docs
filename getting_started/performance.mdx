How to Use Performance

Reflecting on Your Answers

<Tip>
  Performance relies on our **Question Reflection** feature. To learn more, visit our guide [here](/getting_started/questions#question-reflection).  
</Tip>

After answering a question, you’ll rate your confidence in solving it again using a 5-point scale.

💚 5 - Confident – I understand this completely and can explain it to someone else.
💙 4 - Mostly confident – I get it, but I might need a quick refresher.
💛 3 - Somewhat confident – I understand parts of it but need more practice.
🧡 2 - Unsure – I struggled and need to review this concept.
❤️ 1 - Not confident – I didn’t understand this at all and need to study it further.

Your rating automatically saves in the background, contributing to your Performance History and filtering options—so over time, you’ll build a clear picture of your strong and weak areas.

### Understanding Your Performance Metrics

The Performance page provides detailed insights into how well you’re doing across different study areas. It tracks your progress using two key data points:

* **Average Rating** – Measures the quality of your answers based on how you’ve rated yourself.

* **Questions Breakdown** – Tracks the number of questions answered, categorised by rating.

Both of these metrics are broken down across multiple study dimensions, allowing you to see trends in different areas, including:

* **Unit, Topic, Subtopic, Learning Objective** – See how your performance varies across the syllabus.

* **Format** – Tracks your ratings in Multiple Choice, Short Response, and other question types.

* **Year** – Track performance on questions from specific past exams.

* **Difficulty** – Monitor performance across easy, medium, and hard questions.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Tracks questions including Explain, Justify, Evaluate, etc.

By tracking these metrics, Performance helps you make data-driven study decisions to improve your exam preparation.

### Understanding Your Performance Data

**Average Rating**

Your Average Rating is calculated based on how you’ve rated your answers across different metrics. This gives you a clear picture of where you’re performing well and where extra practice might be needed.

For example, if your average rating is higher in multiple-choice questions but lower in short response questions, this may indicate you need more practice with written explanations.

• Spot **weaker areas** that need more focus.

• Track **changes over time** to see improvement in specific topics or question types.

**Questions Breakdown**

The Questions graph helps you visualise the number of questions you’ve answered in each category and how you’ve rated them.

Each bar in the graph is color-coded based on your rating:

* **Dark Green** – 5-Star (Strong performance)

* **Light Green** – 4-Star

* **Yellow** – 3-Star

* **Orange** – 2-Star

* **Red** – 1-Star (Needs improvement)

* **Gray** – Unrated (Questions you haven’t rated)

<Tip>
  To remove a segment from the bar, simply click on it in the legend, and it will be hidden from the graph.

**How to Use It**

* **Identify areas needing improvement** – If a bar has a lot of red and orange, that’s a sign to focus more on those questions.

* **Monitor question volume** – Check if you’ve answered enough questions in a given category.

* **Spot gaps in your study plan** – Unrated questions may indicate areas you haven’t covered yet.
