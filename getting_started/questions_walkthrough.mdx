### Filtering

Filtering helps students and educators quickly find the right questions for their study and teaching needs. Students can use it when preparing for a topic test, revising after a lesson, or targeting weak areas, while educators can filter questions for class discussions, creating worksheets, or assessing student progress.&#x20;
