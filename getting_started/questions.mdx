Questions is at the heart of Exam Insights, offering a flexible playground for exploring past QCAA external exam questions. It’s more than just a question bank—you have full control over what you see by combining powerful filters to narrow down exactly what you need.

Filter by unit, topic, subtopic, difficulty, cognitive verbs, and more to pinpoint the most relevant questions for your study or teaching focus. Whether you’re searching for a specific type of question or a broader range, everything you need is in one place—including the formula book, marking scheme, and any relevant stimulus.

### Filtering

<Note>
  Enjoy this feature for **free—no sign-in required**. Additional filtering options are available with **Plus**.
</Note>

Filtering helps both students and educators quickly find the right questions for their study or teaching needs. Whether you’re preparing for a test, reviewing a topic, or selecting questions for a worksheet, filtering gives you full control over what you see.

<Frame caption="Caption">
  ![](/images/Untitleddesign.png)
</Frame>

Filters work in two ways:

* **AND** – When you select multiple filters from different categories, the results must match all selected filters.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing *Calculate questions AND Hard* difficulty will show only questions that are both *Calculate* and *Hard*.
</Info>

* **OR** – When you select multiple options within the same category, the results can match any of them.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing *Medium OR Hard* difficulty will show all questions that are either *Medium* or *Hard*.
</Info>

***

You can also combine AND & OR to refine your search even further.

<Info>
  **Example:** Selecting *Topic 1 AND (Medium OR Hard difficulty)* will show all *Topic 1 questions* that are *either Medium or Hard*.
</Info>

This gives you full control over your search, letting you narrow down results with AND or expand them with OR to find exactly what you need.

***

<Tip>
  Filtering is like a custom search playground—giving you full flexibility to combine different filters and quickly find the exact questions you need.
</Tip>

You can filter by:

* **Unit, Topic, Subtopic, Learning Objective** – Find syllabus-aligned questions.

* **Question Format** – Multiple choice, short response, extended response.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Identify, Explain, Evaluate, etc.

* **Performance** – Filter based on how you’ve previously rated your answers.

* **Difficulty Level** – Choose easy, medium, or hard questions.
