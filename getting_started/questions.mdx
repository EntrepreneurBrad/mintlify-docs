Questions is at the heart of Exam Insights, offering a flexible playground for exploring past QCAA external exam questions. It’s more than just a question bank—you have full control over what you see by combining powerful filters to narrow down exactly what you need.

Filter by unit, topic, sub-topic, difficulty, cognitive verbs, and more to pinpoint the most relevant questions for your study or teaching focus. Whether you’re searching for a specific type of question or a broader range, everything you need is in one place—including the formula book, marking scheme, and any relevant stimulus.

### Filtering

<Note>
  Enjoy this feature for **free—no sign-in required**. Additional filtering options are available with **Plus**.
</Note>

Filtering helps both students and educators quickly find the right questions for their study or teaching needs. Whether you’re preparing for a test, reviewing a topic, or selecting questions for a worksheet, filtering gives you full control over what you see.

Filters work in two ways:

- **AND** – When you select multiple filters from different categories, the results must match all selected filters.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing _Calculate questions AND Hard_ difficulty will show only questions that are both _Calculate_ and _Hard_.
</Info>

- **OR** – When you select multiple options within the same category, the results can match any of them.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing _Medium OR Hard_ difficulty will show all questions that are either _Medium_ or _Hard_.
</Info>

---

You can also combine AND & OR to refine your search even further.

<Info>
  **Example:** Selecting _Topic 1 AND (Medium OR Hard difficulty)_ will show all _Topic 1 questions_ that are _either Medium or Hard_.
</Info>

This gives you full control over your search, letting you narrow down results with AND or expand them with OR to find exactly what you need.

---

<Tip>
  Filtering is like a custom search playground—giving you full flexibility to combine different filters and quickly find the exact questions you need.
</Tip>

<Frame caption="Filtering on our QCAA Physics Questions Page">
