Questions is at the heart of Exam Insights, offering a flexible playground for exploring past QCAA external exam questions. It’s more than just a question bank—you have full control over what you see by combining powerful filters to narrow down exactly what you need.

Filter by unit, topic, sub-topic, difficulty, cognitive verbs, and more to pinpoint the most relevant questions for your study or teaching focus. Whether you’re searching for a specific type of question or a broader range, everything you need is in one place—including the formula book, marking scheme, and any relevant stimulus.

### Filtering

<Note>
  Enjoy this feature for **free—no sign-in required**. Additional filtering options are available with **Plus**.
</Note>

Filtering helps both students and educators quickly find the right questions for their study or teaching needs. Whether you’re preparing for a test, reviewing a topic, or selecting questions for a worksheet, filtering gives you full control over what you see.

![](/images/Screenshot2025-03-13at11.10.01am.png)

Filters work in two ways:

* **AND** – When you select multiple filters from different categories, the results must match all selected filters.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing *Calculate questions AND Hard* difficulty will show only questions that are both *Calculate* and *Hard*.
</Info>

* **OR** – When you select multiple options within the same category, the results can match any of them.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing *Medium OR Hard* difficulty will show all questions that are either *Medium* or *Hard*.
</Info>

***

You can also combine AND & OR to refine your search even further.

<Info>
  **Example:** Selecting *Topic 1 AND (Medium OR Hard difficulty)* will show all *Topic 1 questions* that are *either Medium or Hard*.
</Info>

This gives you full control over your search, letting you narrow down results with AND or expand them with OR to find exactly what you need.

***

<Tip>
  Filtering is like a custom search playground—giving you full flexibility to combine different filters and quickly find the exact questions you need.
</Tip>

You can filter by:

* **Unit, Topic, Sub-Topic, Learning Objective** – Find syllabus-aligned questions.

* **Question Format** – Multiple choice, short response, extended response.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Identify, Explain, Evaluate, etc.

* **Performance** – Filter based on how you’ve previously rated your answers.

* **Difficulty Level** – Choose easy, medium, or hard questions.

* **Paper / Technology** – Find questions that require a calculator or specific tools.

* **Year** – Select questions from specific past external exams.

***

### **Sorting**

<Note>
  This feature is available with a **Plus** plan.
</Note>

Sorting allows you to organise questions in different ways to suit your study or teaching style.

* **Sort by Year of Publication** – See the newest or oldest questions first.

* **Sort by Difficulty** – Arrange questions from easiest to hardest (or vice versa).

* **Sort Randomly** – Get a mix of different questions for varied practice.

<Tip>
  Filtering narrows down your selection, while sorting and search help you fine-tune it.

### Question Reflection

<Note>
  This feature is free, but requires you to **have a free account**.
</Note>

Track your understanding with a simple 5-scale reflection system. After reviewing the marking scheme, select a rating that best represents how well you understood the question and how confident you are in solving it again.

Your ratings work in the background to:

* Filter questions based on most your recent ratings, so you can focus on areas that need the most improvement.

With minimal effort, you’ll build a clear picture of where to focus, making exam preparation more efficient.
