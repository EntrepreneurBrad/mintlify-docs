Syllabus is your interactive roadmap to mastering a subject, giving you full access to the official QCAA syllabus in a structured and intuitive way. It goes beyond a simple outline, providing dedicated pages for every unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective.

With everything connected, you can focus on what matters most—finding the right questions ([Questions](/getting_started/questions)), tracking your progress ([Performance](/getting_started/performance)), and gaining deeper insights ([Insights](/getting_started/insights))—all in a single, streamlined hub built for effective learning.

### Syllabus

<Note>
  Enjoy this feature for **free—no sign-in required**. Create a **free account** to track Unit and Topic progress, or upgrade to **Pro** for Sub-Topic and Learning Objective tracking.
</Note>

Get a structured and interactive view of the official QCAA syllabus, making it easy to navigate and track your progress across units, topics, sub-topics, and learning objectives.

Alongside a comprehensive syllabus overview, you’ll see your learning progress at every level, helping you quickly identify strengths and areas that need more focus.

#### Your Learning Progress

Each unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective has a learning progress indicator that reflects:

- **Achievement** – Based on your most recent question reflections, how well are you performing? How confident do you feel?
- **Engagement** – When was the last time you answered a question in this area? How much have you actually practiced?

<Tip>
  **For example:**
  If you reflect 5/5 on a single question in a Topic that has 50 questions, your achievement for that topic will be high, but your engagement will be low because you've only completed 1 out of 50 questions.

  To reach 100% progress, you need to answer more questions from that topic and continue reflecting with high understanding and confidence across multiple questions.
</Tip>

Your learning progress helps you stay focused and organised, ensuring you spend time where it matters most.
