Syllabus is your interactive roadmap to mastering a subject, giving you full access to the official QCAA syllabus in a structured and intuitive way. It goes beyond a simple outline, providing dedicated pages for every unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective.

With everything connected, you can focus on what matters most—finding the right questions ([Questions](/getting_started/questions)), tracking your progress ([Performance](/getting_started/performance)), and gaining deeper insights ([Insights](/getting_started/insights))—all in a single, streamlined hub built for effective learning.

### Syllabus

<Note>
  Enjoy this feature for **free—no sign-in required**. Create a **free account** to track Unit and Topic progress, or upgrade to **Pro** for Sub-Topic and Learning Objective tracking.
</Note>

Get a structured and interactive view of your official QCAA syllabus, helping you easily navigate and track your progress across Units, Topics, Sub-Topics, and Learning Objectives.

Not only do you get a clear overview of the entire syllabus, but you're also shown your learning progress for every unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective. This makes it easy to see where you’re excelling and where you need to focus more.

***

#### Your Learning Progress

Each Unit, Topic, Sub-Topic, and Learning Objective has a learning progress indicator that is calculated based on your:  
* **Achievement** – Based on your most recent question reflections, how well are you performing? How confident do you feel?  
* **Engagement** – When was the last time you answered a question in this area? How much have you actually practiced?  

<Tip>
**For example:**
If you reflect 5/5 on a single question in a Topic that has 50 questions, your achievement for that topic will be high, but your engagement will be low because you've only completed 1 out of 50 questions.  

To reach 100% progress, you need to answer more questions from that topic and continue reflecting with high understanding and confidence across multiple questions.
</Tip>

This metric keeps you focused, organised, and aware of your progress, ensuring you spend time where it matters most.
