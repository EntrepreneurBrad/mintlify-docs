Study is your interactive roadmap to mastering a subject, giving you full access to the syllabus in a structured and intuitive way. It goes beyond a simple outline, providing dedicated pages for every unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective.

With everything connected, you can focus on what matters most—finding the right questions ([Questions](/getting_started/questions)), tracking your progress ([Performance](/getting_started/performance)), and gaining deeper insights ([Insights](/getting_started/insights))—all in a single, streamlined hub built for effective learning.

## Using Study

### Navigating Study

When you first open Study for a subject, you'll see an Overview section at the top of the page. This provides a high-level summary of your progress, helping you identify where to focus your study.

**Understanding the Overview Section**

At a glance, the Overview gives you insights into your progress:

* **Attempted vs. Unattempted Learning Objectives** – A graph showing how many learning objectives you've attempted versus those you haven't engaged with yet.

* **Your Weakest Learning Objectives** – A list highlighting the Subject Matters where you've struggled the most, based on your self-rated performance on past questions.

This section helps you quickly identify areas that may need more revision.

**Navigating the Syllabus**

* Scroll through the syllabus to browse units, topics, sub-topics, and learning objectives. Each Subject Matter shows:

  * **Your completion progress** – The percentage of related questions you've attempted.
