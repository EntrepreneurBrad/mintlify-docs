Syllabus is your interactive roadmap to mastering a subject, giving you full access to the official QCAA syllabus in a structured and intuitive way. It goes beyond a simple outline, providing dedicated pages for every unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective.

With everything connected, you can focus on what matters most—finding the right questions ([Questions](/getting_started/questions)), tracking your progress ([Performance](/getting_started/performance)), and gaining deeper insights ([Insights](/getting_started/insights))—all in a single, streamlined hub built for effective learning.

### Reccomended for You

<Note>
  This feature is available with a **Pro** plan.
</Note>

Get personalised recommendations on which Learning Objectives to focus on next, helping you study smarter.

This feature analyses:
* **Your engagement** – When was the last time you answered a question on this Learning Objective?
* **Your achievement** – Based on your most recent question reflections, how well are you performing and how confident do you feel about it?
* **Benchmarking** – Where are your underperforming areas compared to other students across the state?

By considering these factors, we highlight the most valuable Learning Objectives for you to improve on, ensuring you focus on the areas that will make the biggest impact.

<Tip>
  Click on any unit to **jump directly to its section** in the syllabus.

### Syllabus

<Note>
  Enjoy this feature for **free—no sign-in required**. Create a **free account** to track Unit and Topic progress, or upgrade to **Pro** for Sub-Topic and Learning Objective tracking.
</Note>

Get a structured and interactive view of the official QCAA syllabus, making it easy to navigate and track your progress across units, topics, sub-topics, and learning objectives.

Alongside a comprehensive syllabus overview, you’ll see your learning progress at every level, helping you quickly identify strengths and areas that need more focus.

Click on any unit, topic, sub-topic, or learning objective to open its dedicated Overview page, where you’ll find Questions, Insights, and Performance—everything you need.

***

#### Your Learning Progress

Each unit, topic, sub-topic, and learning objective has a learning progress indicator that reflects:
* **Achievement** – Based on your most recent question reflections, how well are you performing? How confident do you feel?
* **Engagement** – When was the last time you answered a question in this area? How much have you actually practiced?

<Tip>
**For example:**
If you reflect 5/5 on a single question in a Topic that has 50 questions, your achievement for that topic will be high, but your engagement will be low because you've only completed 1 out of 50 questions.  

To reach 100% progress, you need to answer more questions from that topic and continue reflecting with high understanding and confidence across multiple questions.
</Tip>

Your learning progress helps you stay focused and organised, ensuring you spend time where it matters most.
