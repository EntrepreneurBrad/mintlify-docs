### Filtering

<Note>
  This feature is available with a **Plus** plan.
</Note>

Just like in Questions, you can filter Insights based on:

* **Unit, Topic, Subtopic, Learning Objective** – Find syllabus-aligned questions.

* **Question Format** – Multiple choice, short response, extended response.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Identify, Explain, Evaluate, etc.

* **Difficulty Level** – Choose easy, medium, or hard questions.

* **Paper / Technology** – Find questions that require a calculator or specific tools.

* **Year** – Select questions from specific past external exams.

This helps both students and educators explore specific trends—allowing students to focus their study efforts on what matters most and educators to gain deeper insights into question patterns.
