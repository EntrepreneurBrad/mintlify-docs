Insights provides a data-driven playground for analysing past QCAA external exams, helping both students and educators identify trends and focus effectively.

Here, you can explore all available data and apply filters to see exactly what matters to you—whether it’s question frequency, mark distribution, or cognitive verb trends. Every data point is interactive, allowing you to drill down into specific topics, question formats, and difficulty levels, eliminating guesswork so students can study smarter and educators can guide learning more strategically.

## How to Use Insights

<Note>
  Enjoy this feature for **free—no sign-in required**. **Filtering** options are available with **Plus**.
</Note>

Insights helps you uncover trends in past exams, showing patterns in:

* **Unit Coverage** – See how often each unit has appeared in past papers.

* **Question Format** – Understand how frequently different question types (i.e. multiple choice, short response) are used.

* **Topic & Subtopics** – Identify which areas within a unit have been tested the most.

* **Question Distribution** – Find out how many questions were asked on certain topics in different exams.

* **Difficulty** – Track whether past exams leaned towards easier, medium, or harder questions.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Analyse which cognitive verbs (i.e. explain, evaluate, justify) are commonly used.

* **Learning Objectives** – See which learning objectives have been tested most commonly multiple years.

* **Question Coverage** -  The proportion of selected vs. all available questions in our question bank (useful when filtering)

### Filtering

<Note>
  This feature is available with a **Plus** plan.
</Note>

Filters work in two ways:

* **AND** – When you select multiple filters from different categories, the results must match all selected filters.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing *Calculate questions AND Hard* difficulty will show only questions that are both *Calculate* and *Hard*.
</Info>

* **OR** – When you select multiple options within the same category, the results can match any of them.

<Info>
  **Example:** Choosing *Medium OR Hard* difficulty will show all questions that are either *Medium* or *Hard*.
</Info>

***

You can also combine AND & OR to refine your search even further.

<Info>
  **Example:** Selecting *Topic 1 AND (Medium OR Hard difficulty)* will show all *Topic 1 questions* that are *either Medium or Hard*.
</Info>

This gives you full control over your search, letting you narrow down results with AND or expand them with OR to find exactly what you need.

***

<Tip>
  Filtering is like a custom search playground—giving you full flexibility to combine different filters and quickly find the exact questions you need.
</Tip>

Just like in Questions, you can filter Insights based on:

* **Unit, Topic, Subtopic, Learning Objective** – Find syllabus-aligned questions.

* **Question Format** – Multiple choice, short response, extended response.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Identify, Explain, Evaluate, etc.

* **Difficulty Level** – Choose easy, medium, or hard questions.

* **Paper / Technology** – Find questions that require a calculator or specific tools.

* **Year** – Select questions from specific past external exams.

This helps both students and educators explore specific trends—allowing students to focus their study efforts on what matters most and educators to gain deeper insights into question patterns.

### Mark Distribution

<Note>
  This feature is available with a **Plus** plan.
</Note>

The Insights page doesn’t just track question trends—it also analyses mark distribution, showing where the most marks are typically awarded in an exam.

<Tip>
  When you filter, you’ll first see **questions**, but you can easily switch to **mark distribution**. This lets you explore both **how often questions appear** and **where the most marks are awarded**, all in one place.
