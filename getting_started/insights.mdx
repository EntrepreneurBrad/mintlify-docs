## What You Can Do on Insights

The Insights Page provides detailed trends on past exams, breaking down key patterns in:

* **Unit** – See how often each unit has appeared in past papers.

* **Format** – Understand how frequently different question types (multiple choice, short response, etc.) are used.

* **Topic & Subtopic** – Identify which areas within a unit have been tested the most.

* **Number of Questions** – Find out how many questions were asked on certain topics in different exams.

* **Difficulty** – Track whether past exams leaned towards easier, medium, or harder questions.

* **Cognitive Verbs** – Analyse which cognitive verbs (e.g., explain, evaluate, justify) are commonly used.

* **Learning Objectives** – See which learning objectives have been tested most commonly multiple years.

* **Coverage** - Amount of selected vs. all available questions (this be relevant when filtering)

### Advanced Filtering

Just like the Questions, you can filter Insights based on:

* **Unit, Topic, Subtopic, Learning Objective**

* **Question Format** (Multiple Choice, Short Response, etc.)

* **Cognitive Verbs** (e.g., Identify, Explain, Evaluate)

* **Performance** (Filter based on how you’ve previously rated your answers)

* **Difficulty Level**

* **Year**

This means you can have a further insight into specific trends, giving you knowledge on how best to study.

### Insights for Both Questions & Marks

The Insights Page doesn’t just show trends for questions—it also tracks mark distribution, helping you see where the most marks are typically awarded in an exam.
