## Our Story & Team

Exam Insights was founded by former students who understand the pressure of exam preparation firsthand. We know how challenging it can be to find the right resources, stay on track, and build confidence before exams. That’s why we created a smarter, more structured way to prepare—giving students instant access to relevant past exam questions, personalised performance insights, and valuable exam trends.

While Exam Insights began as a student-led initiative, it has grown into a trusted platform, backed by a team of educators, engineers, and learning specialists. Together, we are committed to making exam preparation more effective, reliable, and accessible for students, teachers, and schools.

Whether you’re a student looking to sharpen your exam skills, an educator supporting learning, or a parent wanting assurance that your child has the right tools, Exam Insights provides a proven, data-driven approach to exam success.
