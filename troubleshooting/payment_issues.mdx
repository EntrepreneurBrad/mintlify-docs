## Troubleshooting Payment Issues

If you're having trouble making a payment or your transaction was declined, try the steps below to resolve common issues.

***

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Payment Method">
    * Ensure your **credit/debit card** is valid and has sufficient funds

    * If using a **school purchase order**, confirm it has been processed correctly.

    * Try using a **different card or payment method**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Your Card Details">
    * Double-check your **card number, expiration date, and CVC code**.

    * Ensure your **billing address matches** the one linked to your card.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact Your Bank">
    Sometimes, payments are **blocked by your bank** for security reasons.

    * Check for any fraud protection alerts or temporary holds.

    * Call your bank to authorize the transaction and try again.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try a Different Browser or Device">
    * If the payment page isnâ€™t loading, try switching browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

    * Disable any **browser extensions** that might interfere with Stripe.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Look for Stripe Payment Errors">
    Stripe may decline payments due to **security checks** or **insufficient funds**.

    * If you see an error message from Stripe, refer to their [payment support page](https://support.stripe.com/).

    * Wait a few minutes and try processing the payment again.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Duplicate Charges">
    * If you see multiple charges, **only one may be successful**.

    * Refunds for duplicate transactions are processed **within 5â€“10 business days**.
  </Step>
