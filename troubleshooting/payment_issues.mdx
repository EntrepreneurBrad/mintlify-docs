## **Troubleshooting Payment Issues**  

If you're having trouble making a payment or your transaction was declined, try the steps below to resolve common issues.

---

### **🔹 Step 1: Check Your Payment Method**  
✅ Ensure your **credit/debit card** is valid and has sufficient funds.  
✅ If using a **school purchase order**, confirm it has been processed correctly.  
✅ Try using a **different card or payment method**.  

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Verify Your Card Details**  
✅ Double-check your **card number, expiration date, and CVC code**.  
✅ Ensure your **billing address matches** the one linked to your card.  

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Contact Your Bank**  
Sometimes, payments are **blocked by your bank** for security reasons.  
✅ Check for any fraud protection alerts or temporary holds.  
✅ Call your bank to authorize the transaction and try again.  

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Try a Different Browser or Device**  
✅ If the payment page isn’t loading, try switching browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).  
✅ Disable any **browser extensions** that might interfere with Stripe.  

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Look for Stripe Payment Errors**  
Stripe may decline payments due to **security checks** or **insufficient funds**.  
✅ If you see an error message from Stripe, refer to their **[payment support page](https://support.stripe.com/)**.  
✅ Wait a few minutes and try processing the payment again.  

---

### **🔹 Step 6: Check for Duplicate Charges**  
✅ If you see multiple charges, **only one may be successful**.  
✅ Refunds for duplicate transactions are processed **within 5–10 business days**.
