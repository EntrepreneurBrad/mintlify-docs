## Upgrading Your Plan

* You can upgrade anytime through the [Pricing](https://exam-insights.com/pricing/) page or your [Account Settings](https://exam-insights.com/settings/).

* The difference in price between your current plan and the new plan will apply.

* Your upgraded plan will immediately unlock new features.

## Downgrading Your Plan

* Downgrades are not available once a plan has been purchased.

* If you wish to purchase a different plan next year, you can choose a new plan once your existing plan expires.
