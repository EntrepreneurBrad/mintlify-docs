This enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you.

If you choose to sign in through SSO, Exam Insights may collect personal information that is already associated with your integrated service account. By choosing to provide such information during registration or otherwise, you are giving Exam Insights the permission to use, share and store it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

### When And With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?

Exam Insights relies on third-party service providers to perform specific services on our behalf, such as content optimisation, functionality enhancement, infrastructure optimisation, and user account registration/authentication. These providers are instrumental in ensuring optimal website performance and user experience.

In certain circumstances, your personal information may be shared or transferred in the event of a business transfer, including negotiations, mergers, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of our business, either wholly or partially, by another company.

### Where Is Your Personal Data Stored?

Our web application is hosted and its data, including personal data, is stored in Australia. We abide by the Australian Privacy Act and the Privacy Principles governing data collection in Australia.

### How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

We've implemented robust technical and organisational security measures to safeguard your personal information. Alongside encryption protocols, access controls, and advanced technologies, we regularly conduct comprehensive security audits and assessments to identify and address any vulnerabilities proactively. Additionally, we ensure data encryption both in transit and at rest, providing an added layer of protection against unauthorised access.

Continuous monitoring of our systems using automated tools and manual oversight allows us to promptly detect and respond to any suspicious activity or unauthorised access attempts in real-time. Furthermore, our secure development practices ensure that security is prioritised at every stage of product development, reducing the risk of potential vulnerabilities.

All data transmitted between users and our platform is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher to prevent interception or tampering during transfer.

In addition to regular audits, we engage independent security experts to conduct annual penetration testing. Identified vulnerabilities are prioritised and resolved based on risk severity to maintain strong protection.

We perform regular encrypted backups and store them using tamper-proof methods to ensure recoverability and data integrity. These safeguards protect against data loss and ensure we can restore service in the event of system failures or malicious attacks.

Despite these efforts, it's essential to recognise that no system can offer absolute certainty, and users should remain cautious regarding potential risks.

### Can You Export Your Data?
Schools with active licences may request a full export of their data at any time. Data will be provided in commonly used formats such as CSV or JSON to ensure compatibility and portability.

### Is Your Data Sold To Third Parties?

We do not sell, share, or rent your personal information to any third party or use your e-mail address for unsolicited mail.

### Anonymised Performance Data Sharing

Exam Insights may share anonymised, aggregated data to analyse collective performance trends at the school, local, and state levels. Individual data is never shared. Your name and email address are anonymised to ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is disclosed. While the name of your school may be included in these analyses, it cannot be used to identify individual users. Your personal information remains confidential and will never be disclosed without your explicit consent.

### How Long Is Your Information Stored For?

During the active period of your account, we maintain your data securely. Once your account is created, we preserve the information for as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and as required by applicable laws. When your account is active, we continuously assess the need for the data and its relevance to our services.

### How Can I Remove My Information?

If you wish to remove your personal information, please note that this can only be done by deleting your entire account. Unfortunately, we cannot delete individual pieces of information separately; the entire account must be deleted to remove all associated data. If you wish to delete your account, please contact [data-protection@exam-insights.com](mailto:data-protection@exam-insights.com). Once your account is deleted, all associated personal information will be permanently removed from our database, along with any data related to third-party services.

Additionally, we periodically review and manage data. Specifically, at the end of each school year, we automatically delete the accounts of Year 12 students who have graduated, along with their associated data. This ensures that data for users who no longer need our services is removed in a timely manner.
