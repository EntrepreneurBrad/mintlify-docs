Our Refund Policy is designed to provide you with a transparent overview of the terms governing refunds for purchases made on our platform.

This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions pertaining to refunds and replacements for your purchases made on Exam Insights (exam-insights.com). It details the circumstances under which you may be eligible for a refund or replacement, as well as the necessary steps to initiate such requests. If you have specific inquiries or require additional information regarding our refund policy, please contact us at [refunds@exam-insights.com](mailto:refunds@exam-insights.com). We are here to assist you with any concerns you may have related to your purchases.

### Change of Mind

We understand that circumstances may change; however, we do not offer refunds or replacements in cases of a change of mind.

### Major Software Issues

You are eligible for a refund or replacement if you encounter a major problem that significantly impairs the product's functionality. This eligibility applies if the issue persists for over 28 days from the time the Exam Insights team is made aware of the problem.

### Minor Software Issues

For non-major issues, we are committed to resolving problems through software updates or patches within a reasonable time frame. If the issue persists beyond 28 days from the time the Exam Insights team is made aware of the problem, you have the option to request a refund.

### Termination of Purchase

We reserve the right to terminate your purchase at any time if you violate our [Terms of Use](/policies/terms_of_use) Policy. Breaking this policy may result in the termination of your account without eligibility for a refund.
