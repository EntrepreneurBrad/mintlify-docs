Our Cookie Policy outlines how we utilise cookies to improve our services and your interaction with our platform without affecting your privacy.

This Cookie Policy contains information on what cookies are, the cookies and similar technologies used on Exam Insights to recognise you when you visit our website at exam-insights.com. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Exam Insights) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer when you visit [exam-insights.com](https://exam-insights.com) and also when you visit certain other websites.

### Why Do We Use Cookies?

Our use of first- and third-party cookies on the Exam Insights website serves various purposes to enhance your browsing experience. Essential or strictly necessary cookies are vital for the technical operation of our website. They facilitate functions such as user authentication, session management, security and load balancing.

Additionally, we employ analytics cookies, allowing us to recognise and count the number of visitors. These cookies track user movement around the website, providing valuable insights to improve functionality and user navigation. The gathered statistics help us understand user behavior, such as the number of visits to a page. When you register with Exam Insights, registration cookies are generated to determine whether you are signed in or not. These cookies enable our servers to identify your account, granting access to specific services.

Furthermore, functionality cookies are employed to recognise returning visitors, allowing us to personalise content, greet users by name, and remember preferences, such as subjects.

It's important to note that third parties, including advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis, may also use cookies. While these cookies fall into categories such as analytical/performance or targeting, Exam Insights does not have control over them.
