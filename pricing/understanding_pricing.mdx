### No Subscriptions, No Auto-Renewals

We operate on a one-time annual payment model, meaning you won’t be automatically charged when your plan expires. At the end of your term, you can decide whether to renew and select the plan that suits you best.

### Upgrading & Downgrading

• **Upgrading**: You can upgrade your plan at any time. The price difference will be applied, and your new features will be unlocked immediately.

• **Downgrading**: We do not offer downgrades. If you want to downgrade your plan, you can do so when your current plan is up for renewal.

### School Licensing

We provide school-wide licensing options, making it easy for institutions to offer access to their students and teachers.
