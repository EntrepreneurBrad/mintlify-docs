### Does the price per seat include access to all subjects?

It depends on the plan:

• **Single Department License**: Covers all subjects within one department (e.g., Science: Biology, Chemistry, Physics).

• **All-Subjects License**: Provides access to all subjects across all departments.

### What is included in a Single Department License?

A Single Department License includes access to all subjects within a specific department, such as:

• **Science** (Biology, Chemistry, Physics)

### What’s the benefit of an All-Subjects License?

An All-Subjects License allows students and educators to access every subject across all departments. This is the most flexible and comprehensive option.
