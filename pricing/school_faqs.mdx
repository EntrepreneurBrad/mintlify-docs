### What types of school licenses are available?

You have the option to purchase the following licenses:

* **Single Subject License**: Covers only one selected subject per student or educator.

* **All-Subjects License**: Grants access to all subjects across all departments.

Our pricing is designed so that if a student or educator takes more than two subjects, an All-Subjects License provides better value.

***

### What’s the benefit of an All-Subjects License?

An All-Subjects License ensures that students and educators have full access to every subject available on Exam Insights. This is ideal for:

* Students studying multiple subjects.

* Schools looking to provide a comprehensive exam preparation tool.

* Educators who teach or support multiple subjects.

***

### How is account access provided for schools?

We provide access code distribution for schools, ensuring a simple and efficient way to grant students and staff access to Exam Insights.

* Schools receive a batch of unique access codes for easy distribution to students and staff.

* Each code grants access based on the purchased license (Single Subject or All-Subjects).

* Users redeem their code when signing up or within their account settings.

  We provide step-by-step guides on [**Redeeming Access Codes**](/getting_started/access_codes) and [**Creating Your Account**](/getting_started/create_account)
