Exam Insights offers flexible school licencing options to provide students and educators with structured, effective exam preparation. Schools can purchase licences in bulk that grant access to Exam Insights for an entire academic year with no ongoing subscription or automatic renewal.

## How School Licencing Works

A school licence allows institutions to provide Exam Insights access to students and educators using unique upgrade codes. Schools can choose between two licence types:

* **Single Subject Licence –** Grants access to one subject per student or educator.

* **All-Subjects Licence –** Unlocks every subject across all departments.

<Tip>
   If a student or educator needs access to more than two subjects, the **All-Subjects Licence** offers the best value.
</Tip>

After purchasing, schools receive a batch of unique upgrade codes to distribute, which users can redeem during signup or within their account settings.

<Tip>
  We provide step-by-step guides on [**Redeeming Upgrade Codes**](/getting_started/access_codes) and [**Creating Your Account**](/getting_started/create_account)
