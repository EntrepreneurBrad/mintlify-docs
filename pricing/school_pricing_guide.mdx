Exam Insights offers flexible school licencing options to provide students and educators with structured, effective exam preparation. Schools can purchase licences in bulk that grant access to Exam Insights for an entire academic year with no ongoing subscription or automatic renewal.

## How School Licencing Works

A school licence allows institutions to provide Exam Insights access to students and educators using unique access codes. Schools can choose between two licence types:

* **Single Subject Licence –** Grants access to one subject per student or educator.

* **All-Subjects Licence –** Unlocks every subject across all departments.

<Tip>
   If a student or educator needs access to more than two subjects, the **All-Subjects Licence** offers the best value.
</Tip>

After purchasing, schools receive a batch of unique access codes to distribute, which users can redeem during signup or within their account settings.

<Tip>
  We provide step-by-step guides on [**Redeeming Access Codes**](/getting_started/access_codes) and [**Creating Your Account**](/getting_started/create_account)

  <Step title="Confirm Your Order">
    Once your school receives the quote, confirmation is required to proceed. This confirmation allows us to provide access codes before payment is finalised.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive and Distribute Access Codes">
    After confirming your order, we will send access codes that students and teachers can redeem on their accounts to activate their licences.

    <Tip>
      We provide step-by-step guides on [**Redeeming Access Codes**](/getting_started/access_codes) and [**Creating Your Account**](/getting_started/create_account)
    </Tip>

  <Step title="Payment and Invoice">
    After access codes are provided, we will issue an invoice for the quoted amount. Schools can complete payment using one of the following methods:

    * **Bank Transfer (EFT/Direct Deposit)** – Secure payment directly from your school’s account.

    * **Credit/Debit Card** – Convenient online payment via a school-issued card

    <Tip>
      If your school requires a purchase order or specific invoicing details, let us know in advance.
