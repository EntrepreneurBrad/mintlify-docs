Exam Insights offers flexible school licensing options to provide students and educators with structured, effective exam preparation. Schools can purchase bulk licenses that grant access to Exam Insights for an entire academic year with no ongoing subscription or automatic renewal.

## How School Licensing Works

A school license allows institutions to provide Exam Insights access to students and educators using unique access codes. Schools can choose between two license types:

* **Single Subject License –** Grants access to one subject per student or educator.

* **All-Subjects License –** Unlocks every subject across all departments.

<Tip>
   If a student or educator needs access to more than two subjects, the **All-Subjects License** offers the best value.
</Tip>

After purchasing, schools receive a batch of unique access codes to distribute, which users can redeem during signup or within their account settings.

<Tip>
  We provide step-by-step guides on [**Redeeming Access Codes**](/getting_started/access_codes) and [**Creating Your Account**](/getting_started/create_account)
